Spending 3 days making a so-called 'game' with a super awesome team makes me realize that the more I know, the more stupid I'll be.

Knowing that I could not do many things for the team with the lack of knowledge about game engine programming, designing or game play ideas, but the reality was worse than I expected. Yeah, it's way worse. It seemed that I didn't do nothing for the entire event, except some ideas about the story and gameplay, and the game picture that you can see above. Nothing else. The effect of the thing going on let me be down for a moment. Shit, am I that bad ? Hell no!

This event taught me a lesson that I should be focusing on several technologies that I think that will help me in my future, not trying to learn many things that I might use.

Then will come a day I'll be good at making apps as they're good at making games. Definitely.
