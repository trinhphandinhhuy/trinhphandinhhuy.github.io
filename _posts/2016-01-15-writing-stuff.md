I'm not the one for words, definitely.

I'm so suck when it comes to writing an essay or even a small letter. Back in 2009, I got a <a href="http://mrdeco.wordpress.com" target="_blank">small blog</a> where I shared my thoughts about movies, travelling and music. But then I stopped, actually don't remember the reason why. And recently when I've read it again, I can't stop laughing about those articles that I've written. So stupid and naive. And since then, I haven't actually written anything special, except those essays that I had to write in order to pass the IELTS exam.

But now I have to write again, for the purpose of writing thesis. I hope that with this new blog, I can share my thoughts about what I'm interested in, and also, what is bothering me. I hope it'll go well.
